Science is, according to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science), "a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe."  Where as there is much written about science, the history of science, the practice of science, the scientific method, less has been written about the *principles* of science.  While there are essays on the principles of science that one can find on the internet, I found all of them lacking in one respect of another, and thus felt inspired to write my own.  To be honest, I believe that essentially anybody engaged in science would agree with me, however, I often feel that way and am often wrong.  So, if you disagree, please tell me where/how, and perhaps we can construct a more accurate description of the principles of science.  That said, in my view, the minimal set of principles essentially required for science are: wonder, empiricism, and models. It is upon these three pillars, I argue, that all good science rests.  Moreover, any criticism of science, I believe, can reasonably be characterized as criticizing one or more of these pillars.
